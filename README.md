XAI Framework: Explainable AI with SHAP, Grad-CAM, and LRP
==========================================================

Overview
--------

This project presents an **Explainable AI (XAI) framework** that integrates **SHAP**, **Grad-CAM**, and **Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP)** to provide detailed insights into the decision-making process of machine learning models. By leveraging these powerful XAI techniques, the framework aims to highlight the features that drive model predictions and ensure the model is learning meaningful patterns.

The framework has been tested on two datasets:

1.  **Brain Tumor Dataset**: Medical images to predict and classify brain tumors.
2.  **ImageNet Dataset**: General-purpose dataset for image classification tasks.

The results confirm that the framework effectively identifies **correct and relevant features**, demonstrating that the model is learning from meaningful and interpretable patterns.

Features
--------

-   **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**:\
    Provides global and local interpretability by assigning feature importance values to input data.

-   **Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping)**:\
    Visualizes class-specific discriminative regions in an input image using gradient-based heatmaps.

-   **LRP (Layer-wise Relevance Propagation)**:\
    Explains individual predictions by distributing the model output back to its input features.

-   **Multi-Dataset Evaluation**:\
    Validated on diverse datasets (Brain Tumor and ImageNet) to ensure robustness across domains.

Results
-------

1.  **Brain Tumor Dataset**:

    -   The framework successfully highlighted tumor regions as critical features in predictions.
    -   Interpretations aligned with domain expert expectations, ensuring trustworthiness in medical applications.
2.  **ImageNet Dataset**:

    -   Demonstrated correct feature extraction for object classification tasks, validating model generalization.

Both datasets revealed that the underlying models rely on **relevant and interpretable features**, proving their effectiveness and the utility of XAI techniques in ensuring model reliability.

Usage
-----

1.  Prepare your datasets in the required format (see `datasets/` directory for examples).

2.  Run the framework:

    bash

    Copy code

    `python run_xai.py --dataset brain_tumor --technique gradcam`

    Replace `--dataset` with `imagenet` and `--technique` with `shap` or `lrp` to explore other options.

3.  Output explanations and visualizations will be saved in the `outputs/` directory.
